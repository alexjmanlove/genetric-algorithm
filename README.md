# genetric-algorithm

A simple genetic algorithm. 
1. The user offers a string as the target. 
2. The programme randomly generates a population of random strings, whose fitness is calculated using hamming distance from target.
3. Principles of genetic algorithms (namely selection, crossover, mutation) are applied to reach the target string.
